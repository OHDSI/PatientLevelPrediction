Description: A package for creating patient level prediction models. Given a
    cohort of interest and an outcome of interest, the package can use data in the
    OMOP Common Data Model to build a large set of features. These features can then
    be assessed to fit a predictive model using a number of machine learning algorithms.
    Several performance measures are implemented for model evaluation.
