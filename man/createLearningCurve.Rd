createLearningCurve(population, plpData, modelSettings, testSplit = "person",
  testFraction = 0.25, trainFractions = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),

}
\arguments{
\item{population}{The population created using \code{createStudyPopulation()}
that will be used to develop the model.}

\item{plpData}{An object of type \code{plpData} - the patient level
prediction data extracted from the CDM.}

\item{modelSettings}{An object of class \code{modelSettings} created using
one of the function:
\itemize{
  \item{{setLassoLogisticRegression} - a lasso logistic regression
    model}
  \item{\code{setGradientBoostingMachine} - a gradient boosting machine}
  \item{\code{setRandomForest} - a random forest model}
  \item{\code{setKNN} - a k-nearest neighbour model}
}}

\item{testSplit}{Specifies the type of evaluation used. Can be either 
\code{'person'} or \code{'time'}. The value \code{'time'} finds the date
that splots the population into the testing and training fractions
provided. Patients with an index after this date are assigned to the test
set and patients with an index prior to this date are assigned to the
training set. The value \code{'person'} splits the data randomly into
testing and training sets according to fractions provided. The split is
stratified by the class label.}

\item{testFraction}{The fraction of the data, which will be used as the 
testing set in the patient split evaluation.}

\item{trainFractions}{A list of training fractions to create models for.}

\item{splitSeed}{The seed used to split the testing and training set when
using a 'person' type split}

\item{nfold}{The number of folds used in the cross validation (default = 
\code{3}).}

\item{indexes}{A dataframe containing a rowId and index column where the 
index value of -1 means in the test set, and positive integer represents
the cross validation fold (default is \code{NULL}).}

\item{save}{The path to the directory where the models will be saved
(if \code{NULL}, uses working directory).}

\item{saveModel}{Logical indicating whether to save the model once it has
been trained (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{verbosity}{Sets the level of the verbosity. If the log level is at or
higher in priority than the logger threshold, a message will print. The 
levels are:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{DEBUG} - highest verbosity showing all debug statements}
  \item{\code{TRACE} - showing information about start and end of steps}
  \item{\code{INFO} - show informative messages (default)}
  \item{\code{WARN} - show warning messages}
  \item{\code{ERROR} - show error messages}
  \item{\code{FATAL} - be silent except for fatal errors}
}}

\item{clearffTemp}{Clears the temporary ff-directory after each iteration. 
This can be useful, if the fitted models are large.}

\item{minCovariateFraction}{Minimum covariate prevalence in population to
avoid removal during preprocssing.}
}
\value{
A learning curve object containing the various performance measures
 obtained by the model for each training set fraction. It can be plotted
 using \code{plotLearningCurve}.
}
\description{
Creates a learning curve object, which can be plotted using the
 \code{plotLearningCurve()} function.
