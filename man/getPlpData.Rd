\title{Extract the patient level prediction data from the server}
\usage{
getPlpData(databaseDetails, covariateSettings, restrictPlpDataSettings = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{databaseDetails}{The cdm database details created using \code{createDatabaseDetails()}}

\item{covariateSettings}{An object of type \code{covariateSettings} or a list of such objects as created using the
\code{createCovariateSettings} function in the
\code{FeatureExtraction} package.}

\item{restrictPlpDataSettings}{Extra settings to apply to the target population while extracting data.
Created using \code{createRestrictPlpDataSettings()}. This is optional.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of type \code{plpData}, containing information on the cohorts, their
outcomes, and baseline covariates. Information about multiple outcomes can be captured at once for
efficiency reasons. This object is a list with the following components: \describe{
\item{outcomes}{A data frame listing the outcomes per person, including the time to event, and
the outcome id. Outcomes are not yet filtered based on risk window, since this is done at
a later stage.} \item{cohorts}{A data frame listing the persons in each cohort, listing their
exposure status as well as the time to the end of the observation period and time to the end of the
cohort (usually the end of the exposure era).} \item{covariates}{An Andromeda object listing the
baseline covariates per person in the two cohorts. This is done using a sparse representation:
covariates with a value of 0 are omitted to save space. Usually has three columns,
rowId, covariateId and covariateValue'.} \item{covariateRef}{An Andromeda object describing the covariates that have been extracted.}
\item{AnalysisRef}{An Andromeda object with information about which analysisIds from 'FeatureExtraction' were used.} }
}
\description{
This function executes a large set of SQL statements against the database in OMOP CDM format to
extract the data needed to perform the analysis.
}
\details{
Based on the arguments, the at risk cohort data is retrieved, as well as outcomes
occurring in these subjects. The at risk cohort is identified  through
user-defined cohorts in a cohort table either inside the CDM instance or in a separate schema.
Similarly, outcomes are identified
through user-defined cohorts in a cohort table either inside the CDM instance or in a separate
schema. Covariates are automatically extracted from the appropriate tables within the CDM.
If you wish to exclude concepts from covariates you will need to
manually add the concept_ids and descendants to the \code{excludedCovariateConceptIds} of the
\code{covariateSettings} argument.
