\usage{
pfi(
  plpResult,
  population,
  plpData,
  repeats = 1,
  covariates = NULL,
  cores = NULL,
  log = NULL,
  logthreshold = "INFO"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plpResult}{An object of type \code{runPlp}}

\item{population}{The population created using createStudyPopulation() who will have their risks predicted}

\item{plpData}{An object of type \code{plpData} - the patient level prediction
data extracted from the CDM.}

\item{repeats}{The number of times to permute each covariate}

\item{covariates}{A vector of covariates to calculate the pfi for.  If NULL it uses all covariates included in the model.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to use when running this (it runs in parallel)}

\item{log}{A location to save the log for running pfi}

\item{logthreshold}{The log threshold (e.g., INFO, TRACE, ...)}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the covariateIds and the pfi (change in AUC caused by permuting the covariate) value
}
\description{
Calculate the permutation feature importance (pfi) for a PLP model.
}
\details{
The function permutes the each covariate/features \if{html}{\out{<repeats>}} times and
calculates the mean AUC change caused by the permutation.
