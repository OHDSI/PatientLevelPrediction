\usage{
plotSmoothCalibration(
  plpResult,
  smooth = c("loess", "rcs"),
  span = 1,
  nKnots = 5,
  scatter = F,
  type = "test",
  bins = 20,

}
\arguments{
\item{plpResult}{The result of running \code{\link{runPlp}} function. An object containing the
model or location where the model is save, the data selection settings, the
preprocessing and training settings as well as various performance measures
obtained by the model.}

\item{smooth}{options: 'loess' or 'rcs'}

\item{span}{This specifies the width of span used for loess. This will allow for faster
computing and lower memory usage.}

\item{nKnots}{The number of knots to be used by the rcs evaluation. Default is 5}

\item{scatter}{plot the decile calibrations as points on the graph. Default is False}

\item{type}{Whether to use train or test data, default is test.}

\item{bins}{The number of bins for the histogram. Default is 20.}

\item{zoom}{Zoom in on the region containing the deciles or on the data. If not specified
shows the entire space.}

\item{sample}{If using loess then by default 20,000 patients will be sampled to save time}

\item{typeColumn}{The name of the column specifying the evaluation type}

\item{saveLocation}{Directory to save plot (if NULL plot is not saved)}

\item{fileName}{Name of the file to save to plot, for example
'plot.png'. See the function \code{ggsave} in the ggplot2 package for
supported file formats.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
