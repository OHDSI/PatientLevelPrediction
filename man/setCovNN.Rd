\title{Create setting for multi-resolution CovNN model (stucture based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00647.pdf CNN1)}
\usage{
setCovNN(batchSize = 1000, outcomeWeight = 1, lr = 1e-05, decay = 1e-06,
  dropout = 0, epochs = 10, filters = 3, kernelSize = 10,
  loss = "binary_crossentropy", seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{batchSize}{The number of samples to used in each batch during model training}

\item{outcomeWeight}{The weight assined to the outcome (make greater than 1 to reduce unballanced label issue)}

\item{lr}{The learning rate}

\item{decay}{The decay of the learning rate}

\item{dropout}{[currently not used] the dropout rate for regularisation}

\item{epochs}{The number of times data is used to train the model (e.g., epoches=1 means data only used once to train)}

\item{filters}{The number of columns output by each convolution}

\item{kernelSize}{The number of time dimensions used for each convolution}

\item{loss}{The loss function implemented}

\item{seed}{The random seed}
