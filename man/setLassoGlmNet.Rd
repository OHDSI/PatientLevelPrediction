\usage{
setLassoGlmNet(
  nlambda = 100,
  nfolds = 3,
  lambda.min.ratio = 0.01,
  parallel = TRUE,
  measure = "default",
  lambdaStrategy = "min"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nlambda}{The number of lambda values}

\item{nfolds}{How many cross validation folds to perform, default=3}

\item{lambda.min.ratio}{Smallest value of lambda, as fraction of lambda.max which is data derived 
to have the first estimated model have zero coefficients.}

\item{parallel}{TRUE to use parallelization across folds (cores=nfolds)}

\item{measure}{measure to use for selecting best lambda, one of:
"default", "mse", "deviance", "class", "auc", "mae", "C"}

\item{lambdaStrategy}{strategy to select best lambda. Either the one that 
minimizes/maximizes the selected measure (`min`) or the one that's within 1 standard error of that in the
direction of a smaller model (`se`).}
