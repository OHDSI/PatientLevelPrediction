\title{Create setting for lasso logistic regression}
\usage{
setLassoLogisticRegression(
  variance = 0.01,
  seed = NULL,
  includeCovariateIds = c(),
  noShrinkage = c(0),
  threads = -1,
  forceIntercept = F,
  upperLimit = 20,
  lowerLimit = 0.01,
  tolerance = 2e-06,
  maxIterations = 3000,
  priorCoefs = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variance}{Numeric: prior distribution starting variance}

\item{seed}{An option to add a seed when training the model}

\item{includeCovariateIds}{a set of covariate IDS to limit the analysis to}

\item{noShrinkage}{a set of covariates whcih are to be forced to be included in the final model. default is the intercept}

\item{threads}{An option to set number of threads when training model}

\item{forceIntercept}{Logical: Force intercept coefficient into prior}

\item{upperLimit}{Numeric: Upper prior variance limit for grid-search}

\item{lowerLimit}{Numeric: Lower prior variance limit for grid-search}

\item{tolerance}{Numeric: maximum relative change in convergence criterion from successive iterations to achieve convergence}

\item{maxIterations}{Integer: maximum iterations of Cyclops to attempt before returning a failed-to-converge error}

\item{priorCoefs}{Use coefficients from a previous model as starting points for model fit (transfer learning)}
